# Traffic_flow_AI
Our system uses real-time traffic analysis to dynamically adjust signal timings at intersections. It reduces congestion by optimizing green light durations and gives priority to emergency vehicles by temporarily overriding normal signals for faster and safer passage. This improves overall traffic flow and emergency response efficiency.
